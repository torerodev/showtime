## Summary
This _project_ leverages the capibilities of [Containerlab](https://containerlab.dev) to build and run _container-based_ labs and uses [torero](https://torero.dev) as a _unified_ execution layer across your automation tools - [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/), [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/docs/), _Python_, and more. This project is meant to explore the _art of the possible_ as it pertains to scaling automation across _on-premises_ and _public-cloud_ infrastructure.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
Finding examples of automation is great, but doesn't get you very far unless you have _purpose-built_ environments to run the automation against. To get the maximum value out of this project, install and setup [Containerlab from the installation instructions here](https://containerlab.dev/install/).

### ðŸ“’ Project Structure
This project contains the following components:
 - [library](./library/) contains _ready-to-use_ automations separated by tool _(Ansible, OpenTofu, and Python)_.
- [labs](./labs) holds _purpose-built_ Containerlab topologies to run _automations_ against; each lab has a **1:1** relationship with an import file.
- [imports](./imports) are **.yml** files that _inventory_ a set of automations pertaining to a given lab; these are referenced in _Containerlab_ topology files and get imported to the lab at _runtime_.
